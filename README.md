# About
This project has been developed with the focus of creating new options for studying music theory online. After exploring the internet and discovering that their wasn't many options, this application was started in the hopes of adding more options to the pool of available tools in assisting music students with learning music theory. The project covers a few tools such as note reading, note listening and quizzes all with a unique implementation of using a piano to navigate between different pages and to be used for answering questions.
